## Overview

The sliding puzzle is a type of puzzle that appears in many video games. In this puzzle, a player starts at a specific location ('S') and aims to reach the finish ('F') by moving in one of the four cardinal directions. However, except for the start and finish points, the floor is covered in frictionless ice, causing the player to slide until they hit a wall or a rock ('0').
